# Dice roller

Application that rolls a dice. It is made of dice images and a button. The dice images are placed in the middle of the screen and the button is underneath.

Every time the button is pressed, a random number is generated between 1 and 6 and it is then displayed with its corresponding dice image.

Random numbers are always different to the previous generated. The same number can never be generated after itself. For example, if you get a '1', and you dice, you won't get a '1' again.

App can be ran in both Android and iOS as it is developed with react native. It was developed using Expo.
